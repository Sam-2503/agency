- **Typography**: Display headlines in **Syne** (bold, high-character display font) and UI/body elements in **Outfit** (clean, readable geometric sans-serif).
- **Background**: Pure pitch-black (`#050505`) with a global film-grain noise texture overlay and large radial accent glows behind structural sections.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Interactive Navbar
Transparent header that transitions into a glassmorphic border (`backdrop-blur-md bg-black/40 border-b border-white/5`) upon scrolling past the hero. Includes a fully responsive animated mobile overlay menu.

### 2. Immersive Hero Section
- **Stagger reveals**: The headline and subheadings fade and lift on load.
- **Parallax composition**: Multi-layered floating image cards representing agency projects/materials move at varying speeds as the user scrolls.
- **Cursor tracking**: Floating cards slightly pivot/follow the user's mouse pointer using spring physics.
- **Overlapping layout**: Sub-elements overlap card borders, recreating the exact layout depth of premium designs.

### 3. Infinite Testimonials Marquee
A luxury auto-scrolling testimonial ticker. Seamlessly loops and pauses automatically on hover.

### 4. Interactive Services Grid
A sticky two-column layout showing 5 core services. Features glassmorphic cards that reveal glowing orange borders and radial shadows on hover.

### 5. Staggered Featured Work Grid
6 client case studies (SaaS Dashboard, Fitness App, AI Assistant, E-Commerce, Real Estate Portal, Healthcare Telehealth) arranged in an asymmetric editorially-curated layout.

### 6. Interactive Process Timeline
A horizontal progress timeline on desktop (collapses to vertical on mobile) featuring a scroll-linked connecting line that animates/draws itself as you scroll.

### 7. Intersection Counter Metrics
Live metric counters (e.g. 50+ Projects, 20+ Clients, 95% Retention) that count up to their target values once they enter the user's viewport.
